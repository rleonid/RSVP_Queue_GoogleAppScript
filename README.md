Google App Script to Automate sending RSVP (or invitations).
===========================================================

Sometimes, you want to host an event where there's a physical limit to the 
number of attendees (a basketball game, a dinner party at your apartment, or a
presentation) but you're not exactly certain which of a large number of
potential guests can attend. You can send out a large email blast to all of
your friends (potential guests) with a caveat that the there's a limit, but
this might upset people and sets up a race. Another solution is to manually
invite the limited number of people and send out new invites as people decline
or take too long to respond. This script automates the second solution.


Initially, I thought about registering this in the Chrome Web Store, but due
to the logic of the script and the store it is not easy to make the user
who runs the script and the user who sends emails be the same person. That's
why I'm putting this on Github in case anyone finds it useful.
